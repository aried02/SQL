DATABASES

Objectives:
	Recall the Structure of a relational database
	Explain the three types of database anomalies
	Identify the three different types of Relationships that can exist between data
	Create a database schema that is in third normal form

Overview:
	Relational databases most frequently used
		MySQL
		MsSQL
		Oracle
		SQLite
	Non relational databases do exist
		BerkleyDB
		mongoDB

Relational Database Systems
	Databases contain tables
	Tables contain columns which organize data
	Tables store their data in rows
	To interact with a relational database one uses the Structured Query Language
	Each table should have a primary key, prim key used to uniquely identify a single row in a table

Structuring Data
	Insure the data is reliable stored, ensure the following doesnt occur:
		Update Anomalies
		Deletion Anomalies
		Insertion Anomalies
	Must normalize the structure of the database

Data Relationships
	One-to-One:
		Each person has only one birthday
		Generally stored in the same table
	One-to-Many:
		Each person has many clothes
		Separate table used to store the clothes
	Many-to-Many:
		Each person has many friends
		Separate "join table" is used to track the relationship data

Video Game Example:
	Track the games each person plays (atomic = one value)
		Game Name -- Atomic
		System -- Atomic
		Name of Person -- First name and Last Name
		Gamertag -- atomic
		Rating of Game -- atomic
		Hours Played -- atomic
	1) Ensure Atomic
	2) Identify Tables (ID is primary key, pretend its underlines)
		People(ID, firstName, lastName, gamerTag)
		Games(ID, name, rating, system)
		Systems(ID, name)
		people-systems(personID, systemID) --dashed underline to denote foreign keys
		games-people(gameID, personID, hoursplayed)

Column Datatypes
	TEXT
	INTEGER
	REAL

CREATE TABLE tbl_name
(
	col_name datatype, ...
);

CREATE TABLE person
(
	firstName TEXT,
	lastName TEXT,
	Age INT
);

Combine database and python with CRUD

crud is common programming task wheree we need to allow the common user to interact with the database
	Create (INSERT)
	Read (SELECT)
	Update (UPDATE)
	Delete (DELETE)

1. First we display a list of rows from a table in the database
2. Them we allow the user to choose an action from above
